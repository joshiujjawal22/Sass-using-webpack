# Sass using Webpack(LOADER)

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

If you want to follow along: Each branch in this project is a step along the path to creating a fully functional webpack setup. In each branch, there will be a documentation file that lists out the steps taken in that branch (each step is also roughly a git commit if you look at the history) which you can use as a checklist when setting up your own projects. 


## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone it:

```
git clone -- git@github.com:[your-user-name]/webpack-express.git --
```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in server.js

OR

- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build-dev```
